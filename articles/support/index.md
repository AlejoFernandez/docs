# Support Options

Auth0 offers support for __all__ subscribers. All customers, even on free accounts, can use our [discussion forum](https://ask.auth0.com) to receive support from our engineers. Additionally, paid accounts receive support via email (<support@auth0.com>). Email response times will vary based on your support plan (shown below). Additionally, our 24/7 support customers will be provided a support phone number.

Our __Premium Support__ option is recommended for all subscribers using Auth0 in a production environment.
