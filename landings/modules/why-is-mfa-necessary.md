title: "Why is Multifactor necessary?"
content: "Use MFA to provide increased security to your critical applications, especially when abnormal situations are detected, such as login from a different device or location. MFA requires the user to have two or more types of credentials before being able to access an account. Even if your password is stolen, your account will remain safe."
