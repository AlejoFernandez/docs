According to [Gartner](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/identity-and-access-management-iam/), Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the security discipline that enables the right individuals to access the right resources at the right times for the right reasons. IAM addresses the mission-critical need to ensure appropriate access to resources across increasingly heterogeneous technology environments.

Enterprises traditionally used on-premises IAM software to manage identity and access policies, but nowadays, as companies add more cloud services to their environments, the process of managing identities is getting more complex. Therefore, adopting cloud-based Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) and cloud IAM solutions becomes a logical step.
