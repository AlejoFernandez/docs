Adding Social Login to your applications has several perks.

- **Increase registrations**: according to a [Web Hosting Buzz survey](http://www.webhostingbuzz.com/blog/2013/03/21/whos-sharing-what/):
**86 percent of users report being bothered by having to create new accounts on websites**. Some of these users would rather leave your site than register, which means that providing Social Login to your apps will increase the number of registrations to your site. The survey also states that 77 percent of respondents say that "Social Login is a good solution that should be in any site."

- **Email is verified**: The social network provider is in charge of verifying the user's email. If the provider shares this information (_Twitter_ does not share the user email address, for example) you will get a real email address rather than the fake addresses that some users typically use to register in web applications. Additionally, the providers will handle the password recovery process.

- **Access richer user profiles**: Social network providers can give you additional information about users, such as location, interests, birthday, and more. Using this data, you can target personalized content to the user.

- **Up-to-date profiles**: Users do not tend to keep their profiles updated in most applications they use, but they do it in social networks. Therefore, having Social Login ensure that you have accurate information about your users.

- **One-click return experience**: After users register in your application using Social Login, their return experience will be very simple, as they will probably be logged into the social network, and just one click will be enough to login to your application.
