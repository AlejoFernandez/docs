title: "Why do you need Identity and Access Management?"
---

Identity and Access Management technology can be used to initiate, capture, record, and manage user identities and their access permissions. All users are authenticated, authorized, and evaluated according to policies and roles.

Poorly controlled IAM processes may lead to regulatory non-compliance; if the organization is audited, management may not be able to prove that company data is not at risk of being misused.
