AngularJS is one of the world's most popular JavaScript frameworks for creating Single Page Applications. Developed by Google, Angular provides a host of tools that make it easy to wire up the various pieces that are required for a SPA. Things like two-way databinding, HTTP requests, templating, and routing are made simple with the AngularJS core library and third-party libraries contributed by the community. 

As with other SPA frameworks, Angular is only concerned with the front end and is agnostic about the server side. This decoupling, along with the client-side architecture that Angular provides, ultimately allows for greater flexibility as applications grow.
