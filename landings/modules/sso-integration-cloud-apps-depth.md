You can enable **Single Sign On** for your corporate applications like **Salesforce**, **Dropbox**, **Slack**, and much more! With Auth0, this is just a few clicks away. Auth0 provides out-of-the-box support for more than 15 cloud applications. What if your application is not in the list of our pre-integrated apps? No problem! We also support the main industry standards such as SAML, WS-Fed, and OAuth 2.0 so you can hook any third-party application that you need.
