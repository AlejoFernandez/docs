Auth0 can authenticate your users with **any identity provider** running on any stack any device or cloud. It provides **Single Sign-On**, **Multifactor Authentication**, **Social Login**, and several more features.

You can read more about Auth0 features here: [Why Auth0?](https://auth0.com/why-auth0).

In terms of authorization, you can use the power of the [rules engine](https://auth0.com/docs/rules) to define coarse-grained authorization â€” that is, rules that dictate who can login (for example: at what times, from which locations and devices, and so on).

Auth0 also has a **group memberships** feature that can be exposed to the application (for example: group memberships in Active Directory, in Azure Active Directory, in the userâ€™s metadata, and so on); based on that, you can do more fine-grained authorization (where only users in a particular group can access some applications).

We are always working on improving **Auth0** and making things simpler; therefore, you can expect updates in these areas soon. ðŸ˜‰
