A **Refresh Token** is a special kind of token that can be used to obtain a renewed access token —that allows accessing a protected resource— at any time. You can request new access tokens until the refresh token expires. Refresh tokens must be stored securely by an application because they essentially allow a user to remain authenticated forever.
