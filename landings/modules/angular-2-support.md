Angular 2 has yet to be officially released and is [not recommended for production](http://splintercode.github.io/is-angular-2-ready/), but you can still use Auth0 in your Angular 2 apps. Our **angular2-jwt** helper library makes it easy to send authenticated HTTP requests to your server and to handle routing based on the userâ€™s authentication state.
