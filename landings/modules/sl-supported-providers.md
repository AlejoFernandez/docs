Auth0 supports 30+ social providers: _Facebook_, _Twitter_, _Google_, _Yahoo_, _Windows Live_, _LinkedIn_, _GitHub_, _PayPal_, _Amazon_, _vKontakte_, _Yandex_, _37signals_, _Box_, _Salesforce_, _Salesforce (sandbox)_, _Salesforce Community_, _Fitbit_, _Baidu_, _RenRen_, _Weibo_, _AOL_, _Shopify_, _WordPress_, _Dwolla_, _miiCard_, _Yammer_, _SoundCloud_, _Instagram_, _The City_, _The City (sandbox)_, _Planning Center_, _Evernote_, _Evernote (sandbox)_, and _Exact_. Additionally, you can add any OAuth2 Authorization Server you need.

â€‹Every provider has its own profile properties, required headers, and response format, and some use OAuth1 (_Twitter_) while others use OAuth2. Auth0 simplifies this for you, encapsulating the differences, and unifying the way to call providers and the information retrieved from all of them.

How about including **Social Login** in your application for free? Try our new free production-ready plan, which includes support for two social network providers of your choice. For more information, check our [pricing page](https://auth0.com/pricing#free).
