Multifactor Authentication is important to provide enhanced security to your critical systems. This will prevent attackers that only have one of these factors gaining access to your accounts, for example if your password is stolen, you will have another layer of protection.

The MFA extra layers could be triggered on abnormal or specific situations, such as login from a different device, location, or time frame.
