1. In Auth0's Management Dashboard, click **Connections** and then **Social**.
2. Flip the switch of the selected social network provider to enable it.
3. Select the applications in which you would like to use this provider.
4. The configuration popup will display. There you can select the desired attributes and permissions that you want to get from the provider. You can also enter your own _App/Consumer Keys_ in this screen.

    > **Tip:** In the settings of each provider, there is a link explaining how to obtain your key for that provider. If you do that, the consent page will show your logo instead of Auth0's and you'll be able to use Auth0 to do SSO for these connections.

5. Click **Save**.
