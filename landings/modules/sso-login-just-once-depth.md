Single Sign On provide your users with a seamless authentication experience when they navigate either through the applications you have built and/or third party apps. That is once you log into one of these applications, you won't have to enter your credentials again when entering another one, as you will be automatically logged in all of them, regardless of the platform, technology, or domain.
Don't make your internal employees nor your external users go through the hassle of maintaining and remembering yet another credential.
