Cloud IAM typically includes the following features:

- **Single Access Control Interface**. Cloud IAM solutions provide a clean and consistent access control interface for all cloud platform services. The same interface can be used for all cloud services.

- **Enhanced Security**. You can define increased security for critical applications.

- **Resource-level Access Control**. You can define roles and grant permissions to users to access resources at different granularity levels.
