It can be difficult for a company to start using cloud Identity and Access Management solutions because they don't directly increase profitability, and it is hard for a company to cede control over infrastructure. However, there are several perks that make using an IAM solution very valuable, such as the following:

- The ability to spend less on enterprise security by relying on the centralized trust model to deal with Identity Management across third-party and own applications.

- It enables your users to work from any location and any device.

- You can give them access to all your applications using just one set of credentials through [**Single Sign-On**](https://auth0.com/learn/how-to-implement-single-sign-on).

- You can protect your sensitive data and apps: Add extra layers of security to your mission-critical apps using [**Multifactor Authentication**](https://auth0.com/learn/get-started-with-mfa).

- It helps maintain compliance of processes and procedures. A typical problem is that permissions are granted based on employees' needs and tasks, and not revoked when they are no longer necessary, thus creating users with lots of unnecessary privileges.
